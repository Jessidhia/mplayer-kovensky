Documentation:

 * continue MEncoder tutorial

 * review manual page again

 * split manual page

 * update and rewrite the XML documentation

 * check documentation for completeness

 * write documentation HOWTO/rules document

 * write -lavdopts documentation

 * continue ipod/embedded device encoding guide

 * document channels.conf syntax

 * ability for multiple languages/locales in one binary

Small improvements:

 * vo_mga should completely blank the screen like fbdev and tdfxfb
   (maybe there should be an option - some people seem to like it the
   way it is, but then fbdev should also behave like this..)

 * Debian package creates mplayer.conf.1 .2 ...

 * Make the output windows remember their positions when resizing to
   double size.

 * Ability to resize to full size/double size/triple (or half) size
   upon key presses.

 * add help suboption to -lavcopts vcodec=/acodec=, -lavfopts format=,
   -subcp, and anything else that needs it.

 * ability to cycle switch_aspect

 * ability to rename vo_jpeg,vo_gif,vo_png output filename

Cleanup:

 * integrate dvdnav into mplayer structure

 * integrate libmpdvdkit2 into mplayer structure (message system and
   command line options)

 * remove all obsolete code, options, files etc

 * Restructure configure and fix CPU flags supported but not shown.

 * Port libmpdemux demuxers to libavformat or write your own from scratch.
   libmpdemux is considered deprecated and should eventually be removed.
   As of 2008-01-28, the following demuxers are missing from libavformat:

   - TiVo (ty streams, not TiVo To Go)
   - VIVO
   - VQF
   - XMMS
   - libnemesi
   - SL support for MPEG-TS


Filters:

 * get filters to work in more colorspaces

 * eq filter should support RGB in addition to YUV

 * move filters into ffmpeg

 * autocrop filter

 * insert af volnorm during playback

 * allow frame insertion & removal in video filters (with timestamps)

 * xinerama video filter that splits movie to 2 screens (like zr)

 * mixing of multiple videos (picture in picture, review shmem patch)

 * video watermark/logo filter (apply vf_overlay patch?)

 * fade to black filter

 * crossfade filter (audio and video)

Enhancements:

 * support for VirtualDub and Winamp plugins (apply af_wadspa patch!)

 * implement xawtv config file parser (for channels, etc)

 * G400 2nd head through mga_vid ;)

 * do more things automagically

 * guess correct DVD title

 * SYUV and paletted RGB support in swscaler

 * implement Plextor compatible SCSI VCD reading

 * DXVA / DXVA2 -vo for Windows

 * GDI -vo for older windows versions

 * hardware MPEG encoding support (Ati cards)

 * make -ass-use-margins work on widescreen video only! (not 4/3 video)
   (automagically put subtitles in black bars)

 * nsc playlist support

 * implement Jack Transport API

 * Stream quality selection, possibly based on available bandwidth.
   Currently only available for MMS-over-HTTP (libmpdemux/asf_streaming.c).

 * MOD playback (via libmodplug?) - bug #434

 * allow multiple -dump* options at the same time - bug #70

 * scale osd when video window changes size

 * get -ass working in mencoder

 * rotate/position osd

 * support all image formats in mf:// (psd, jpeg2000)

 * make -noborder work with all video outputs

Difficult stuff:

 * RE all closed source codecs (Voxware, VIVO, MVI2, MSS1/MSS2, ...)

 * support for Bink codec

 * write something like mptv to replace xawtv

 * write/adapt a C implementation of live555 RTSP

 * unify live555 and Real RTSP

 * real mmsu:// support

 * top notch DVD navigation like a hardware player

 * write mpdump application to handle all -dump* options

 * modular MEncoder with audio encoding API

 * multiple audio stream output in Mencoder

 * support for pausing/resuming of encoding in MEncoder

 * DRM support (divx.com, Real.com, iTunes)

 * variable-fps output support for MEncoder

 * smooth stream switching / multiple file caching to avoid the small skip
   between files when playing multiple files

 * reverse playback

 * more directshow filter/muxer support

 * encode and display video at the same time

 * write mpimage for displaying pictures

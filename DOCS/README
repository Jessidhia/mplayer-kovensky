## Reading the MPlayer Documentation ##
#######################################

Thanks for reading MPlayer documentation !!!


1. For "release" version users (i.e. non-Subversion):

   a, Enter the HTML/ directory, and there you'll find the documentation,
      each language in its own subdirectory.

   b, If you prefer reading the documentation as a single big file it
      can be found in the file MPlayer.html, each language in its
      own subdirectory.

   c, If the HTML/ directory does not contain your language,
      try the subdirectories in this very same folder.


2. For "development" version users (i.e. Subversion or Subversion snapshots):

   a, Enter the xml/ directory, and read the README file there to find
      out how to build a HTML version of the XML documentation. It will
      be created in the HTML/ directory.

   b, If the xml/ directory doesn't contain your language, try the
      subdirectories in this very same folder.

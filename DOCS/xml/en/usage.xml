<title>Command line</title>

<para>
<application>MPlayer</application> utilizes a complex playtree. Options passed
on the command line can apply to all files/URLs or just to specific ones
depending on their position. For example
<screen>mplayer -vfm ffmpeg movie1.avi movie2.avi</screen>
will use FFmpeg decoders for both files, but
<screen>
mplayer -vfm ffmpeg <replaceable>movie1.avi</replaceable> <replaceable>movie2.avi</replaceable> -vfm dmo
</screen>
will play the second file with a DMO decoder.
</para>

<para>
You can group filenames/URLs together using <literal>{</literal> and
<literal>}</literal>. It is useful with option <option>-loop</option>:
<screen>mplayer { 1.avi -loop 2 2.avi } -loop 3</screen>
The above command will play files in this order: 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2.

<para>
The command line options differ slightly for the different formats:
</para>

<formalpara>
<title>VOBsub subtitles</title>
<para>
VOBsub subtitles consist of a big (some megabytes) <filename>.SUB</filename>
file, and optional <filename>.IDX</filename> and/or <filename>.IFO</filename>
files. If you have files like
<filename><replaceable>sample.sub</replaceable></filename>,
<filename><replaceable>sample.ifo</replaceable></filename> (optional),
<filename><replaceable>sample.idx</replaceable></filename> - you have to pass
<application>MPlayer</application> the <option>-vobsub sample
[-vobsubid <replaceable>id</replaceable>]</option> options
(full path optional). The <option>-vobsubid</option> option is like
<option>-sid</option> for DVDs, you can choose between subtitle tracks
(languages) with it. In case that <option>-vobsubid</option> is omitted,
<application>MPlayer</application> will try to use the languages given by the
<option>-slang</option> option and fall back to the
<systemitem>langidx</systemitem> in the <filename>.IDX</filename> file to set
the subtitle language. If it fails, there will be no subtitles.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara>
<title>Other subtitles</title>
<para>
The other formats consist of a single text file containing timing,
placement and text information. Usage: If you have a file like
<filename><replaceable>sample.txt</replaceable></filename>,
you have to pass the option <option>-sub
<replaceable>sample.txt</replaceable></option> (full path optional).
</para>
</formalpara>

<variablelist>

  </para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
If you experience a growing delay between the movie and the subtitles when
using a MicroDVD subtitle file, most likely the framerate of the movie and
the subtitle file are different. Please note that the MicroDVD subtitle
format uses absolute frame numbers for its timing, but there is no fps
information in it, and therefore the <option>-subfps</option> option should
be used with this format. If you like to solve this problem permanently,
you have to manually convert the subtitle file framerate.
<application>MPlayer</application> can do this
conversion for you:

<screen>
mplayer -dumpmicrodvdsub -fps <replaceable>subtitles_fps</replaceable> -subfps <replaceable>avi_fps</replaceable> \
    -sub <replaceable>subtitle_filename</replaceable> <replaceable>dummy.avi</replaceable>

<sect1 id="edl" xreflabel="Edit Decision Lists (EDL)">
<title>Edit Decision Lists (EDL)</title>

<para>
The edit decision list (EDL) system allows you to automatically skip
or mute sections of videos during playback, based on a movie specific
EDL configuration file.
</para>

<para>
This is useful for those who may want to watch a film in "family-friendly"
mode. You can cut out any violence, profanity, Jar-Jar Binks .. from a movie
according to your own personal preferences. Aside from this, there are other
uses, like automatically skipping over commercials in video files you watch.
</para>

<para>
The EDL file format is pretty bare-bones. There is one command per line that
indicates what to do (skip/mute) and when to do it (using pts in seconds).
</para>

<!-- ********** -->

<sect2 id="edl_using">
<title>Using an EDL file</title>

<para>
Include the <option>-edl &lt;filename&gt;</option> flag when you run
<application>MPlayer</application>, with the name of the EDL file you
want applied to the video.
</para>
</sect2>

<!-- ********** -->

<sect2 id="edl_making">
<title>Making an EDL file</title>

<para>
The current EDL file format is:
<programlisting>[begin second] [end second] [action]</programlisting>
Where the seconds are floating-point numbers and the action is either
<literal>0</literal> for skip or <literal>1</literal> for mute. Example:
<programlisting>
5.3   7.1    0
15    16.7   1
420   422    0
</programlisting>
This will skip from second 5.3 to second 7.1 of the video, then mute at
15 seconds, unmute at 16.7 seconds and skip from second 420 to second 422
of the video. These actions will be performed when the playback timer
reaches the times given in the file.
</para>

<para>
To create an EDL file to work from, use the <option>-edlout
&lt;filename&gt;</option> flag. During playback, just hit <keycap>i</keycap> to
mark the beginning and end of a skip block.
A corresponding entry will be written to the file for that time.
You can then go back and fine-tune the generated EDL file as well as
change the default operation which is to skip the block described by each line.

<sect2 id="advaudio-surround-DVD">
<title>DVDs</title>

<para>
Most DVDs and many other files include surround sound.
<application>MPlayer</application> supports surround playback but does not
enable it by default because stereo equipment is by far more common. To play a
file that has more than two channels of audio use <option>-channels</option>.
For example, to play a DVD with 5.1 audio:
<screen>mplayer dvd://1 -channels 6</screen>
Note that despite the name "5.1" there are actually six discrete channels.
If you have surround sound equipment it is safe to put the
<option>channels</option> option in your <application>MPlayer</application>
configuration file <filename>~/.mplayer/config</filename>. For example, to make
quadraphonic playback the default, add this line:
<programlisting>channels=4</programlisting>
<application>MPlayer</application> will then output audio in four channels when
all four channels are available.
</para>
</sect2>


<sect2 id="advaudio-surround-stereoinfour">

<para>
<application>MPlayer</application> does not duplicate any channels by default,

<sect2 id="advaudio-surround-passthrough">
<title>AC-3/DTS Passthrough</title>

<para>
DVDs usually have surround audio encoded in AC-3 (Dolby Digital) or DTS
(Digital Theater System) format. Some modern audio equipment is capable of
decoding these formats internally. <application>MPlayer</application> can be
configured to relay the audio data without decoding it. This will only work if
you have a S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface) jack in your sound card, or
if you are passing audio over HDMI.
</para>

<para>
If your audio equipment can decode both AC-3 and DTS, you can safely enable
passthrough for both formats. Otherwise, enable passthrough for only the format
your equipment supports.

<sect2 id="advaudio-surround-hrtf">
<title>Surround emulation in headphones</title>

<para>
<application>MPlayer</application> includes an HRTF (Head Related Transfer
Function) filter based on an
<ulink url="http://sound.media.mit.edu/KEMAR.html">MIT project</ulink>
wherein measurements were taken from microphones mounted on a dummy human head.
</para>

<para>
Although it is not possible to exactly imitate a surround system,
<application>MPlayer</application>'s HRTF filter does provide more spatially
immersive audio in 2-channel headphones. Regular downmixing simply combines all
the channels into two; besides combining the channels, <option>hrtf</option>
generates subtle echoes, increases the stereo separation slightly, and alters
the volume of some frequencies. Whether HRTF sounds better may be dependent on
the source audio and a matter of personal taste, but it is definitely worth
trying out.
</para>

<para>
To play a DVD with HRTF:
<screen>mplayer dvd://1 -channels 6 -af hrtf</screen>
</para>

<para>
<option>hrtf</option> only works well with 5 or 6 channels. Also,
<option>hrtf</option> requires 48 kHz audio. DVD audio is already 48 kHz, but if
you have a file with a different sampling rate that you want to play using
<option>hrtf</option> you must resample it:

The <option>-channels</option> option is used to request the number of
channels from the audio decoder. Some audio codecs use the number of specified
channels to decide if downmixing the source is necessary. Note that this does
not always affect the number of output channels. For example, using
<option>-channels 4</option> to play a stereo MP3 file will still result in
2-channel output since the MP3 codec will not produce the extra channels.
</para>

<para>
The <option>channels</option> audio filter can be used to create or remove

card. See the following sections for more information on channel manipulation.

<title>Playing mono with two speakers</title>

<para>
Mono sounds a lot better when played through two speakers - especially when
using headphones. Audio files that truly have one channel are automatically
played through two speakers; unfortunately, most files with mono sound are
actually encoded as stereo with one channel silent. The easiest and most
foolproof way to make both speakers output the same audio is the
<option>extrastereo</option> filter:
<screen>mplayer <replaceable>filename</replaceable> -af extrastereo=0</screen>
</para>

<para>
This averages both channels, resulting in both channels being half as loud as
the original. The next sections have examples of other ways to do this without a
volume decrease, but they are more complex and require different options
depending on which channel to keep. If you really need to maintain the volume,
it may be easier to experiment with the <option>volume</option> filter and find
the right value. For example:
<screen>
mplayer <replaceable>filename</replaceable> -af extrastereo=0,volume=5
</screen>
</para>

<sect2 id="advaudio-channels-copying">
<title>Channel copying/moving</title>

<para>
The <option>channels</option> filter can move any or all channels.
Setting up all the suboptions for the <option>channels</option>
filter can be complicated and takes a little care.

<orderedlist spacing="compact">
<listitem><para>
  Decide how many output channels you need. This is the first suboption.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  Count how many channel moves you will do. This is the second suboption. Each
  channel can be moved to several different channels at the same time, but keep
  in mind that when a channel is moved (even if to only one destination) the
  source channel will be empty unless another channel is moved into it. To copy
  a channel, keeping the source the same, simply move the channel into both the
  destination and the source. For example:
  <programlisting>
channel 2 --> channel 3
channel 2 --> channel 2<!--
  --></programlisting>
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  Write out the channel copies as pairs of suboptions. Note that the first
  channel is 0, the second is 1, etc. The order of these suboptions does not
  matter as long as they are properly grouped into
  <replaceable>source:destination</replaceable> pairs.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<bridgehead>Example: one channel in two speakers</bridgehead>
<para>
Here is an example of another way to play one channel in both speakers. Suppose
for this example that the left channel should be played and the right channel
discarded. Following the steps above:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>
  In order to provide an output channel for each of the two speakers, the first
  suboption must be "2".
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  The left channel needs to be moved to the right channel, and also must be
  moved to itself so it won't be empty. This is a total of two moves, making
  the second suboption "2" as well.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  To move the left channel (channel 0) into the right channel (channel 1), the
  suboption pair is "0:1", "0:0" moves the left channel onto itself.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
Putting that all together gives:
<screen>
mplayer <replaceable>filename</replaceable> -af channels=2:2:0:1:0:0
</screen>
</para>

<para>
The advantage this example has over <option>extrastereo</option> is that the
volume of each output channel is the same as the input channel. The disadvantage
is that the suboptions must be changed to "2:2:1:0:1:1" when the desired audio
is in the right channel. Also, it is more difficult to remember and type.
</para>

<bridgehead>Example: left channel in two speakers shortcut</bridgehead>
<para>
There is actually a much easier way to use the <option>channels</option> filter
for playing the left channel in both speakers:
<screen>mplayer <replaceable>filename</replaceable> -af channels=1</screen>
The second channel is discarded and, with no further suboptions, the single
remaining channel is left alone. Sound card drivers automatically play
single-channel audio in both speakers. This only works when the desired channel
is on the left.
</para>

<bridgehead>Example: duplicate front channels to the rear</bridgehead>
<para>
Another common operation is to duplicate the front channels and play them back
on the rear speakers of a quadraphonic setup.
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>
  There should be four output channels. The first suboption is "4".
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  Each of the two front channels needs to be moved to the corresponding rear
  channel and also to itself. This is four moves, so the second suboption is "4".
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  The left front (channel 0) needs to moved to the left rear (channel 2):
  "0:2".  The left front also needs to be moved to itself: "0:0". The right
  front (channel 1) is moved to the right rear (channel 3): "1:3", and also to
  itself: "1:1".
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
Combine all the suboptions to get:
<screen>
mplayer <replaceable>filename</replaceable> -af channels=4:4:0:2:0:0:1:3:1:1
</screen>
</para>
</sect2>


<sect2 id="advaudio-channels-mixing">
<title>Channel mixing</title>

<para>
The <option>pan</option> filter can mix channels in user-specified proportions.
This allows for everything the <option>channels</option> filter can do and
more. Unfortunately, the suboptions are much more complicated.
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>
  Decide how many channels to work with. You may need to specify this with
  <option>-channels</option> and/or <option>-af channels</option>.
  Later examples will show when to use which.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  Decide how many channels to feed into <option>pan</option> (further decoded
  channels are discarded). This is the first suboption, and it also controls how
  many channels to employ for output.
</para></listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
  The remaining suboptions specify how much of each channel gets mixed into each
  other channel. This is the complicated part. To break the task down, split the
  suboptions into several sets, one set for each input channel. Each suboption
  within a set corresponds to an output channel. The number you specify will be
  the percentage of the input channel that gets mixed into the output channel.
  </para>
  <para>
  <option>pan</option> accepts values from 0 to 512, yielding 0% to 51200% of
  the original volume. Be careful when using values greater than 1. Not only
  can this give you very high volume, but if you exceed the sample range of
  your sound card you may hear painful pops and clicks. If you want you can
  follow <option>pan</option> with <option>,volume</option> to enable clipping,
  but it is best to keep the values of <option>pan</option> low enough that
  clipping is not necessary.
  </para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<bridgehead>Example: one channel in two speakers</bridgehead>
<para>
Here is yet another example for playing the left channel in two speakers. Follow
the steps above:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>
  <option>pan</option> should output two channels, so the first
  suboption is "2".
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  Since we have two input channels, there will be two sets of suboptions.
  Since there are also two output channels,
  there will be two suboptions per set.
  The left channel from the file should go with full volume to
  the new left and the right channels.
  Thus the first set of suboptions is "1:1".
  The right channel should be discarded, so the second would be "0:0".
  Any 0 values at the end can be left out, but for ease of
  understanding we will keep them.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
Putting those options together gives:
<screen>mplayer <replaceable>filename</replaceable> -af pan=2:1:1:0:0</screen>
If the right channel is desired instead of the left, the suboptions to
<option>pan</option> will be "2:0:0:1:1".
</para>


<bridgehead>Example: left channel in two speakers shortcut</bridgehead>
<para>
As with <option>channels</option>, there is a shortcut that only works with the
left channel:
<screen>mplayer <replaceable>filename</replaceable> -af pan=1:1</screen>
Since <option>pan</option> has only one channel of input (the other channel is
discarded), there is only one set with one suboption, which specifies that the
only channel gets 100% of itself.
</para>

<bridgehead>Example: downmixing 6-channel PCM</bridgehead>
<para>
<application>MPlayer</application>'s decoder for 6-channel PCM is not capable of
downmixing. Here is a way to downmix PCM using <option>pan</option>:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>
  The number of output channels is 2, so the first suboption is "2".
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  With six input channels there will be six sets of options. Fortunately,
  since we only care about the output of the first two channels, we only need to
  make two sets; the remaining four sets can be omitted. Beware that not all
  multichannel audio files have the same channel order! This example
  demonstrates downmixing a file with the same channels as AC-3 5.1:
  <programlisting>
0 - front left
1 - front right
2 - rear left
3 - rear right
4 - center front
5 - subwoofer<!--
  --></programlisting>
  The first set of suboptions lists the percentages of the original volume, in
  order, which each output channel should receive from the
  front left channel: "1:0".
  The front right channel should go into the right output: "0:1".
  The same for the rear channels: "1:0" and "0:1".
  The center channel goes into both output channels with half volume:
  "0.5:0.5", and the subwoofer goes into both with full volume: "1:1".
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
Put all that together, for:
<screen>
mplayer <replaceable>6-channel.wav</replaceable> -af pan=2:1:0:0:1:1:0:0:1:0.5:0.5:1:1
</screen>
The percentages listed above are only a rough example. Feel free to tweak them.
</para>

<bridgehead>Example: Playing 5.1 audio on big speakers without a subwoofer</bridgehead>
<para>
If you have a huge pair of front speakers you may not want to waste any money on
buying a subwoofer for a complete 5.1 sound system. If you use
<option>-channels 5</option> to request that liba52 decode 5.1 audio in 5.0,
the subwoofer channel is simply discarded. If you want to distribute the
subwoofer channel yourself you need to downmix manually with
<option>pan</option>:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>
  Since <option>pan</option> needs to examine all six channels, specify
  <option>-channels 6</option> so liba52 decodes them all.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  <option>pan</option> outputs to only five channels, the first suboption is 5.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
  Six input channels and five output channels means six sets of five suboptions.
  <itemizedlist spacing="compact">

<sect1 id="advaudio-volume">
<title>Software Volume adjustment</title>

<para>
Some audio tracks are too quiet to be heard comfortably without amplification.
This becomes a problem when your audio equipment cannot amplify the signal for
you. The <option>-softvol</option> option directs
<application>MPlayer</application> to use an internal mixer. You can then use
the volume adjustment keys (by default <keycap>9</keycap> and
<keycap>0</keycap>) to reach much higher volume levels. Note that this does not
bypass your sound card's mixer; <application>MPlayer</application> only
amplifies the signal before sending it to your sound card.
The following example is a good start:
<screen>
mplayer <replaceable>quiet-file</replaceable> -softvol -softvol-max 300
</screen>
The <option>-softvol-max</option> option specifies the maximum allowable output
volume as a percentage of the
original volume. For example, <option>-softvol-max 200</option> would allow the
volume to be adjusted up to twice its original level.
It is safe to specify a large value with
<option>-softvol-max</option>; the higher volume will not be used until you
use the volume adjustment keys. The only disadvantage of a large value is that,
since <application>MPlayer</application> adjusts volume by a percentage of the
maximum, you will not have as precise control when using the volume adjustment
keys. Use a lower value with <option>-softvol-max</option> and/or specify
<option>-volstep 1</option> if you need higher precision.
</para>

<para>
The <option>-softvol</option> option works by controlling the
<option>volume</option> audio filter. If you want to play a file at a certain
volume from the beginning you can specify <option>volume</option> manually:
<screen>mplayer <replaceable>quiet-file</replaceable> -af volume=10</screen>
This will play the file with a ten decibel gain. Be careful when using the
<option>volume</option> filter - you could easily hurt your ears if you use
too high a value. Start low and work your way up gradually until you get a feel
for how much adjustment is required. Also, if you specify excessively high
values, <option>volume</option> may need to clip the signal to avoid sending
your sound card data that is outside the allowable range; this will result in
distorted audio.

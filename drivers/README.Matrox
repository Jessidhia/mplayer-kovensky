The code in this directory is the old mga_vid driver for Linux kernels
prior to 2.6. It does _not_ compile for version 2.6.x.

For Linux kernel 2.6.x please get the newest version of the 2.6 port from

                       WARNING  -----  WARNING

This code messes with your video card and your X server. It will probably
lock up your box, format your hard drive, and cause your brand new G400
MAX to spout 6 inch flames. You have been warned.

What does this code do?

         mga_vid is a kernel module that utilitizes the Matrox G200/G400/G550
         video scaler/overlay unit to perform YUV->RGB colorspace conversion
         and arbitrary video scaling.

         mga_vid is also a monster hack.

How does mga_vid work?

        This kernel module sets up the BES (backend scaler) with appropriate
        values based on parameters supplied via ioctl. It also maps a chunk of
        video memory into userspace via mmap. This memory is stolen from X
        (which may decide to write to it later). The application can then write
        image data directly to the framebuffer (if it knows the right padding,
        etc).


How do I know if mga_vid works on my system?

        There is a test application called mga_vid_test. This test code should
        draw some nice 256x256 images for you if all is working well.

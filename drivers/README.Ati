        framebuffer driver for ATI Radeon chipset video boards
        ======================================================

These files are replacement for linux-2.4.x-ac.y drivers.
To use this driver you should have at least linux-2.4.5-ac.1
then simply replace linux/drivers/video/radeon* with files
from this directory.
Note: since linux-2.4.10 this driver was moved from -ac to
Linus distribution.

Alternative way:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Simply type two commands in this directory:
make
make install

Anyway you should have 'framebuffer support' compiled into linux-kernel
and at least '8bpp packed pixel support' compiled and installed as module.
(But if you plan to use this module with MPlayer you also should have
16bpp, 24bpp and 32bpp pixel support compiled as modules).


                      Radeon video overlay
                      ====================

It was designed for MPlayer and currently can be used only by MPlayer.
It's RGB-YUV BES for Radeon cards (althrough there is experimental
support for Rage128 / Rage128pro chips).

rage128_vid is contained within radeon_vid.c. As for a Rage128 framebuffer -
use the one from your Linux distribution.

Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simply type two commands in this directory:
make
make install

Using with MPlayer:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently there is only one way to use ATI's drivers:
mplayer -vo vesa:lvo:/dev/radeon_vid -<your vesa's options> filename
or
mplayer -vo vesa:lvo:/dev/rage128_vid -<your vesa's options> filename

For YV12 formats you can use also:
mplayer -vo mga:/dev/radeon_vid -<your mga's option> filename

but in this case you should load at least radeonfb driver from
this package.

Configuring:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can tune some parameters with the following trick:
echo "parameter=value" > /dev/radeon_vid
Example (disables adaptive deinterlacing):
echo "deinterlace=off" > /dev/radeon_vid

To know more about these parameters - try reading the /dev/radeon_vid file ;)
For example:
cat /dev/radeon_vid

List of parameters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have Rage128 chip:
brightness=decval          (-64:+63) changes brightness
saturation=decval          (0:+31) changes saturation 0 == grayscale mode
else - if you have Radeon:
brightness=decval          (-1000:+1000) -1000 == black screen
saturation=decval          (-1000:+1000) -1000 == grayscaled mode
contrast=decval            (-1000:+1000) -1000 == black screen
hue=decval                 (-1000:+1000) -1000 == +1000 (full circle)
                           all other values are within this range
Note: 0 is the default value for every parameter on Radeons.
WARNING: This driver violates the rule: "no float in the kernel".
So if you have problems then don't use color correction.

double_buff=on/off         enables/disables double buffering
deinterlace=on/off         enables/disables adaptive deinterlacing
deinterlace_pattern=hexval defines deinterlacing pattern

Driver parameters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use some additional parameters during module loading:
Example:
modprobe radeon_vid swap_fourcc=1

List of driver parameters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mtrr=1/0                   Configures MTRR (if available), default = 1.
swap_fourcc=1/0            Performs byte swapping of passed fourcc.
                           (It's required for compatibility with -vo mga.)

To know more about driver parameters execute:
modinfo radeon_vid
or
modinfo rage128_vid

Note:
~~~~~
For command line of MPlayer:
You can pass only options with can be recognized by vo_vesa driver.
(Indeed radeon_vid and rage128_vid are stupid things and can only create
video overlay. Mode switching and other adjustments are performed by the
vo_vesa driver. This mean that they use the VESA BIOS as graphics server.)

Conclusion:
~~~~~~~~~~~
This stuff (radeon(rage128)_vid) currently doesn't support any standards.

Full example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
modprobe radeon_vid mtrr=1
echo "deinterlace_pattern=F0055555" > /dev/radeon_vid
mplayer -vo vesa:lvo:/dev/radeon_vid -fs -zoom -bpp 32 filename

Enjoy!

mplayer for Debian
----------------------

  Most options are autodetected or configured during compilation thus
  users are supposed to build this package themselves.

  If you want do force some options, add them to mplayer_options in the top
  directory.

  Build the package using 'dpkg-buildpackage -b -j<number of jobs>'. For details
  see dpkg-buildpackage documentation.
